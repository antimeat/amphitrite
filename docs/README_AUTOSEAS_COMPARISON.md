title: Comparison API for Autoseas Algorithms
---

## Overview

---

This API, `comparison_api.cgi`, is designed for comparing different autoseas algorithms for sea state predictions based on wind conditions at a given site. It leverages fetch and depth tables specific to each site, essential for calculating the sea states generated by the autoseas process.

## API Endpoint

---

-   **URL**: `http://wa-vw-er/webapps/er_ml_projects/davink/amphitrite_dev/amphitrite/comparison_api.cgi`

## Request Parameters

The API accepts the following query parameters:

1. **`site`** (required)

    - Format: String with `%20` for spaces
    - Description: Specifies the site name for which the sea state is to be calculated.

2. **`src`** (optional)

    - Values: `autoseas`, `partition`, `smush`
    - Description: Determines the source of the sea state calculation.
        - `autoseas`: Direct calculation from autoseas based on wind data.
        - `partition`: Utilizes Auswave swell partitioned data.
        - `smush`: Combines Auswave partitioned data with autoseas generated data, selecting the highest energy at each timestep.

3. **`get`** (optional)

    - Values: `ofcast_archived`
    - Description: Get the winds from ofcast.

4. **`data_type`** (optional)

    - Values: `forecast`
    - Description: Get the forecast winds from ofcast.

## Response Format

The API responds with an HTML document that includes:

-   Comparative tables of the sea state predictions from different algorithms.
-   Detailed tables for each algorithm showing wind conditions and resulting sea states.
